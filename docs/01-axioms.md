# The Three Axioms

These aren't predictions. They're axioms. Build from them.

## Axiom 1: No Sentient AI - Ever

> "Don't worry, AI will never be sentient. The reason I feel everyone keeps on shifting the AGI goalposts is another way of saying that we're waiting for some kind of consciousness sentient breakthrough."
>
> *— May 2024 | ChatGPT*

> "AI will never be sentient by definition. It's a machine. It's an algorithm. It's a predictive model algorithm, and therefore it needs humans to drive it."
>
> *— August 2025 | Claude Code*

**Implication:** Stop waiting for AI to "wake up." It won't. Build accordingly.

## Axiom 2: We Are Going to Keep Control - Always

> "It is the responsibility of the person who controls or has agency over their AI, whatever the AI does. And therefore no matter how good AI gets, it's always going to need the human trigger always. Because in reality that's exactly where the responsibility lies."
>
> *— May 2025 | Claude Code*

> "100% human orchestrating of AI - I call it 'AI in the loop' as a contrarian to the stupid 2025 'human in the loop'"
>
> *— December 2025 | Claude Code*

**Implication:** The question isn't "how do we keep AI under control?" The question is "how do we make human control efficient enough to keep up?"

## Axiom 3: Only As Fast As AI Can Explain

> "Only as fast as AI can explain to us and AI can empower us to decide with confidence"
>
> *— September 2025 | Claude Code*

> "The natural and inevitable bottleneck by definition is the ability of AI to 'download' the data to the human so he understands enough to have 100% agency."
>
> *— August 2025 | Claude Code*

**Implication:** The speed limit isn't compute. It's cognition. AI moves at the speed of human understanding, not the other way around.

## The Non-Negotiables

1. **No sentient AI** — it's not coming, stop designing for it
2. **Human sovereignty** — every decision has a human trigger
3. **Understanding before action** — confidence before speed

Everything else is implementation detail.

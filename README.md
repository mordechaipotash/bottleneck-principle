# The Bottleneck Principle

> "The bottleneck isn't AI capability anymore. It's human reception."

A framework for human sovereignty in the age of AI.

## The Core Thesis

Somewhere between GPT-3.5 and Claude 3, something shifted. AI capability stopped being the constraint.

The new bottleneck: **Can humans understand enough to decide with confidence?**

Everyone thinks the solution is making AI more human-like. More autonomous. More intelligent.

Wrong direction. The solution isn't smarter AI. It's better translation.

## The Inversion

| Industry Says | This Framework Says |
|---------------|---------------------|
| "Human in the loop" | "AI in the loop" |
| Human supervises AI | Human conducts, AI executes |
| Eliminate bottlenecks | Amplify through bottlenecks |
| AI needs to be smarter | Humans need better translation |

---

## The Formula

```
Scarce_Resource(bottleneck) × Amplifier(AI/process) = Outsized_Value
```

Don't eliminate the bottleneck. Amplify through it.

## Quick Start

Paste [seed.json](seed.json) into any LLM. Type "unpack" and explore.

## The Numbers Behind This

This framework emerged from:
- **353K** conversation messages (2023-2026)
- **106K** embedded messages with semantic search
- **10,000+** hours of AI-native development
- **3 years** of building cognitive prosthetics
